# IOP SSI (Project Morpheus) Crypto

This package contains crypto utilities built from our [keyvault-rust](https://github.com/Internet-of-People/keyvault-rust).

> Even though it's a separated package, we suggest you to use our [SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@internet-of-people/sdk) instead as it contains more feature complete tools.
